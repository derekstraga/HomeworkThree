# Homework Three 
For this homework I decided to start from scratch instead of use the prewritten files given to get more experience. I looked up tons of documentation and a video I found on youtube to make what I made. The whole experience taught me so much about functions, getElementbyId and how it's used, and a lot more. 

## Additional features
I added a Copy to Clipboard by using a new function execCommand to copy the password to the clipboard and setting an alert for that action. I added a slider to select the password length and a generate button. I made all css and styling for the page completely independently. 

### Additional Notes
By doing the homeworks I am finally feeling much more comfortable with Git and Github. I'd say that has been the hardest part for me weirdly enough.
